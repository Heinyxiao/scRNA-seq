# Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis toolkit
This repository covers the scRNA-seq analyses done for my thesis research. I performed single-cell RNA sequencing using primary ovarian cancer (OC) cells and primary cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and analyzed ligand-receptor interactions between OC cells and CAFs in co-cultured vs mono-cultured conditions.   

My analyses include: 
    **Human genome alignment**
    **Dataset integration**
    **Imputation**
    **Quanlity control**
    **Normalizaiton**
    **Dimension Reduction**
    **Cell type assignment**
    **Ligand-receptor interaction**
