# Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis toolkit
This repository covers the scRNA-seq analyses done for my thesis research. I performed single-cell RNA sequencing using primary ovarian cancer (OC) cells and primary cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and analyzed ligand-receptor interactions between OC cells and CAFs in co-cultured vs mono-cultured conditions.   

My analyses include: 

+ **Human Genome Alignment**
+ **Dataset Integration**
+ **Imputation**
+ **Quanlity Control**
+ **Normalizaiton**
+ **Dimension Reduction**
+ **Differential Expresison (DE) Testing**
+ **Cell Type Assignment**
+ **Ligand-Receptor Interaction**
