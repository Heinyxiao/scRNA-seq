# Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis
This repository covers the scRNA-seq analyses done for ovarian tumor microenvironment research. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed using primary ovarian cancer (OC) cells and primary cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The bioinformatics analysis uncovered ligand-receptor interactions between OC cells and CAFs.
